## Introduction

In this exercise you will be building a backend system to process customer orders and provide data to frontend clients via an API.
We have provided a skeleton rails app to get you started, please familiarise yourself with the existing application structure before getting started.

Here is a brief overview of the existing models in the application:
- **Bouquet**: This is a representation of a Bouquet of flowers that is available for ordering / delivery.
- **Order**: This is a simple representation of a customer order. The customer can choose the date of their first delivery as `first_delivery_date`.
- **OrderType**: Customers can choose either a "Single delivery" or a "3 month bundle". In the future, we may expand this to other order types.
- **Delivery**: An individual delivery to a recipient. An Order can have one or more Deliveries.
- **ShippingOption**: Customers can choose different options for shipping, which may be free or charged.

For the purposes of this exercise, we are not concerned with delivery addresses.

## What We'll be looking for:

* A clean and simple solution
* Done in a conventional way
* With solid test coverage

You are welcome to change any part of the existing skeleton app if your solution requires it.

## Tasks

1. Add a rake task called "shipping".
   * When this task runs it should take a date
    as an argument and create a "Delivery" object for all the orders going out
    on that date which have a status of "billed".
   * Note that orders for the "3 month bundle" type should have a total of three deliveries, 28 days apart from each other.
   * It should set the status of an order to "complete" when all the deliveries for that order have been created.

2. The "Free shipping" shipping option shouldn't be available to book over bank holidays.
   * Please update the rake task
    to move any deliveries with bank holiday date to the next non-bank holiday date. For example deliveries for 1st January 2020 should be moved to the 2nd January 2020.
   * List of bank holidays - https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays / https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays.json.

3. Expose delivery information (recipient name, bouquet name, order ID, shipping option name and price) through a public API endpoint for the mobile apps team to use. While you should consider how the API endpoint would be used by a mobile app, please don't implement any authentication in the API.
   * You are welcome to choose the format / build it yourself or use any gem to solve the problem.
